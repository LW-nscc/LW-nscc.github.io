            <h1 id="about_me">About me</h1>
            <p>I am a developer living in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.  I was born March 1<sup>st</sup> 2002 in Mississauga Toronto, moving to Nova Scotia in 2015.  Around that time I began programming.</p>
            <p>In 2020 I began taking game development seriously, focusing on Unity. Then in 2022 I enrolled in college, which introduced me to low level languages, web development & frameworks and best practices.</p>
            <p>Today, I am interested in Game and Web Development</p>
            <p>For Game Development, I am focused on Unity, I also use Blender to create models, Krita to create textures and FL Studio for audio and music.</p>
            <p>For Web Development, I am not focused on one particular technology, and have used Vue, PHP, Django and Node.</p>
            <p>However, I am enthusiastic to learn new technologies if required for a role.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <h2>Use of AI</h2>
            <p>I do not use AI/LLMs when programming my personal projects.  If an employer asks that I do so, I am happy to use them, however I am also happy to not use them if an employer asks me not to.</p>

                    <p>My first real game project, a Train Simulator.</p>
                    <p>Through this project I learned most of my Unity and Game Dev skills, such as handling user input, managing, tracking and saving users progress, settings, and such.</p>
                    <p>It also allowed me to become much better at creating models and textures.</p>

                    <p>The end goal would be to have a full race that the cars will run, which can be watched from trackside cameras like a real race.</p>

                    <p class="date">Created September 2025</p>
                    <p>This project was to make a site similar to the Image Board I created with Vue.</p>
                    <p>Building off of what I learned from the Microblogging site I made with Django, I also added users, allowing users to delete their content. Finally I added a view count, which goes up every time the post is viewed.</p>
                    <p>With the users, I gave each user a profile page, with a list of all their posts on the side, and a total view count of all their posts.</p>
