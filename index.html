        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Leonard Wylie. I was born in Toronto and moved to Yarmouth in
            2016. I’m currently taking the IT Programming course at NSCC Burridge Campus, Starting in September 2022. I
            began seriously coding in 2018, I took a coding class in 2019 and 2020 in high school. During the pandemic I
            began using the Unity Game Engine. </p>
        <p>I have written code in Java, C#, Python and HTML/CSS. I’d say personally I prefer HTML/CSS because of its
            simplicity, but I enjoy all the other languages. I also have a experience with 3d modelling with blender and
            have limited experience with music production and sound design.</p>
        <p>Programs I have used:</p>
        <ul>
            <!--Audacity,Blender,FL Studio,Paint.NET,Unity,VS Code-->
            <li>Audacity</li>
            <li>Blender</li>
            <li>FL Studio</li>
            <li>Paint.NET</li>
            <li>Unity</li>
            <li>VS Code</li>
        </ul>
