            <h2>Nicholas Latifi to leave Williams F1 at the end of the Year</h2>
            <h3>2022-09-23</h3>
            <h4>Written by: Reporter Olivia</h4>
            <p>After beginning with Williams in 2020, <b>Nicholas Latifi is set to not return to the team next year.</b> 
                The Canadian will leave Williams after scoring 7 world driver championship points through his 3 year 
                stint with the team (at time of writing, as of the 2022 Italian Grand Prix).</p>

            <p>Williams Grand Prix Engineering, Williams Racing or simply as Williams began life in 1977. Founded by 
                Sir Frank Williams. The team was once the top of the grid, notable drivers include Ayrton Senna, 
                Damon Hill, Alain Prost and many others. Once holding the record for 9 constructors championships 
                in a row. However, in 2017, the team was in financial hardship. To help, Williams would sign on 
                Lance Stroll, son of Canadian Billionaire Lawrence Stroll. As reported by Autoweek.com:</p>

            <p>Stroll would remain with Williams for 2018, however, Lawrence was looking elsewhere. Specifically Force India 
                (would become Racing Point, now Aston Martin).  At the same time, Vijay Mallya, Force India’s CEO would be 
                extradited from the United Kingdom, accused of fraud and defaulting on loans. Force India would enter 
                administration, an effort spearheaded by one of their own drivers, Sergio Perez.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Stroll would eventually takeover 
                the team and become their CEO, of course meaning a seat for his son Lance, and an empty seat at Williams. 
                At this time the team would also change its name to Racing Point</p>
            <p>Williams would sign two new drivers for their 2019 season. Robert Kubica and George Russell. However, they would 
                face financial issues and require more funding. Robert Kubica would leave the team for unrelated reasons, and who 
                would replace him? Nicholas Latifi.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Similar to Lance Stroll, Latifi would come with funding. Michael Latifi, his father is Chairman and CEO of 
                Sofina Foods Inc. Sofina is currently a sponsor of Williams, however its doubtful if this will continue following 
                todays announcement. Claire Williams, daughter of Sir Williams would leave the team at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, 
                now the team is under the management of Jost Capito and in a much better financial situation. Meaning they do not 
                require what is slangily known as a “Pay Driver”.</p>

            <p>Williams has not yet announced who will replace the Canadian, but it is rumoured that Nyck De Vries may take up 
                his role, after his unexpected outing at this year’s Italian Grand Prix. Hopefully, now that the team is in a much 
                better position, they can rise their way up the midfield, and maybe even become title contenders like the “good ol’ 
                days”, the days of the late Sir Frank Williams.</p>

            <p><b>Formula E champion Nyck de Vries stood in for William’s driver Alex Albon</b> for the third practice session at the 
                2022 Italian Grand Prix. However, he suddenly found himself in the deep end <b>after complications with Appendicitis

            <p>As part of F1s effort to allow “lower series” drivers help build their experience and help them reach F1, there is 
                what is know as the young drivers program. This program requires all teams to let a driver other then their 
                primary drivers participate in a number of free practice sessions. This weekend, Williams planned to let De Vries 
                participate in such an outing. This was all that was planned for the young dutchmen. However it was soon revealed 
                that Albon would not be able to participate in the grand prix, and De Vries was quickly informed that his work 
                was not quite finished.</p>

            <p>De Vries would Qualify his car 13th and would start 8th after grid penalties to cars ahead. He would finish in 9th, 
                scoring 2 championship points. After the race De Vries was helped from the car.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Can someone help me or am I alone in Parc Ferme? I can literally not even lift my arms anymore.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>It seems that the much larger g forces from the much faster and grippier Formula 1 cars, compared to the Formula E 
                Nyck is used to took a toll on him. Which is to be expected, as not being a F1 driver means he is not used to the 
                strain and does not train for such forces. Along with this Formula E races only last 45 minutes, where a Formula 1 
                races tends to last upwards of 90.</p>

            <p>The most important part of this story is that <b>Alex Albon has now made a full recovery from his complications</b>. 
                He is planned to return after the break for the Singapore grand prix.</p>
            <p>With the two points scored by De Vries, this brings the total number of Constructors Points achieved by Williams up 
                to 6. 4 scored by Alex Albon, 2 by De Vries and 0 by Nicholas Latifi. There is little surprise that rumors of Nyck 
                replacing the Latifi at Williams have spread like wildfire. As of now, there has been no statement by Williams as 
                to their 2023 driver lineup.</p>

            <p>Oscar Piastri, Alpines Reserve Driver was under contract until the beginning of August 2022. One day before the contract 
                was set to expire, Alpine driver Fernando Alonso announced he would be leaving for Aston Martin racing. 
                This sparked rumors that Piastri would replace Alonso at the team. Alpine release a statement saying that 
                Piastri would take up this role, however Piastri soon released a statement via twitter that this would not be the case.</p>

            <p>It is currently unclear who will drive for both McLaren & Alpine at this time. All we can do at this time is speculate. We however can confidently
